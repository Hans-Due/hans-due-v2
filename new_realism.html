        <h2>ON THE WORKS...</h2>
        <p> Hans Due’s graphics and paintings portray our times through subjects from known objects, icons and brands. Perhaps his pictures can be best described as New Realism.

With a dimensional contrast with the authentic subjects, his subjects are depicted visually as distressed, naturalistic and recognisable either as a whole or as a detail. The subjects are well-known and versatile from CocaCola tins to Gauloises cigarette packets, Capitaine Cook’s Sardines, a One-way sign from Madison Avenue or Latin translations of proverbs.

The works are in a disquieting way a thought-provoking, provocative experience from our everyday lives and the times we live in. Their topical messages speak powerfully to our subconscious and become part of our identity – without us noticing it…</p>
