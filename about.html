          From when he could first hold a pencil, Hans Due has drawn and
          visually formulated his impressions. As a teenager his interest became
          more focused. At evening classes he received instruction in drawing
          and painting, while having his creative powers tested and meeting
          like-minded individuals. This all strengthened his aspiration towards
          an education in fine art.
        </p>
        <p>
          He left secondary school with a dream of training to be a draughtsman,
          painter or sculptor. There was much verbal encouragement from his
          parents, but beyond this there was no tradition nor the finances for
          further support.

          But finances were needed, so as a first step he found work in a print
          shop. Here he enjoyed his first contact with the established
          Copenhagen art world. By good fortune, the firm's customers included
          several museums and artists to whom he was often despatched with
          proofs and colour samples for approval. He took advantage of this
          contact and established good relations with a number of the artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three artists went as far as to take him on as their pupil: the
          illustrator Des Asmussen, painter August Tørsleff and the sculptor,
          Professor Gottfred Eickhoff. They were each in their field authorities
          in the established Danish art scene, something of which he was
          initially unaware. They were very different personalities and their
          equally different criticisms, advice and tutelage made for a highly
          instructive period.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the print shop, he experienced the dynamism of the advertising
          industry of the late 1950s. He was inspired by the industry's furious
          pulse and succeeded in gaining an apprenticeship at a graphic design
          studio. This was a severe disappointment for the three artists who had
          hoped to see him at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts - and going
          for a “commercial” training, this was about as low as an artist could
          stoop…

          The graphical training was of great benefit. Beyond graphical methods,
          he learnt the full range of drawing techniques and routines, such as
          the use of pencil, pen, brush, photo, film, colours, materials, etc.
          After work, he pursued his artistic ambitions and, among other places,
          drew at the Royal Academy's life-drawing school in Nyhavn.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the end of his apprenticeship approached, it was also clear that,
          if he wanted access to more important and challenging tasks, this
          would require broader theoretical knowledge. He therefore applied to
          and was accepted into the Graphic Arts Institute of Denmark's design
          studio. The two-year programme combined theory and practice, divided
          into lectures during the daytime and assignments outside of school
          hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June 1964, he graduated, bursting with energy, inspiration and a
          desire for new creative challenges. His first steps were to test out
          his ambitions in Paris, where he worked in graphics and photography -
          but ambitions and finances were not well matched. Back in Copenhagen,
          he started freelancing for printers, publishers and advertising
          agencies. Then followed a period of employment with various
          advertising agencies and design firms.

          In 1974 he set up his own company specialising in communication,
          corporate identity and design. The commissions here ranged widely,
          from solutions for total design concepts to identity programmes,
          logos, graphic design, photography, product development, product
          design, exhibitions, interior design and architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many exciting and challenging commissions, which, with the
          aid of many skilled colleagues, turned into sound solutions for a wide
          range of private, industrial and public-sector customers. That the
          commissions became “solutions” is borne out by a good number of
          diplomas and prizes - and not least by customers, some of whom have
          followed the firm since its establishment in 1974.
        </p>
        <p>
          But his heart has always belonged to the visual arts, which he has
          cultivated intensely alongside day-to-day assignments. In 2005 he
          decided to concentrate exclusively on the visual arts. He resigned
          from the firm and set up a studio from where he works full time on
          graphics and painting.
